    <h2 id="who-we-are">Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      Evangelical Chinese Church (ECC) is a Christian church community that
      seeks to grow, equip, love and serve others for the glory of God. We are
      located in North Parramatta in Sydney.
    </p>
    <p>
      We offer a contemporary English-speaking service at 9:30am every Sunday
      morning. By providing a single church service in which all generations
      gather to learn from the Bible together, our church aspires to generate a
      warm family culture which stems from our love for Christ and each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are a diverse community made up of young families, students, young
      workers and seniors. Regardless of what stage of life you are in, we hope
      that you will feel at home at ECC. As a small but growing church, we
      provide a personal and friendly environment for discovering who Jesus is
      and getting to know one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you want to find out more about Jesus or are already a Christian,
      we would love for you to join us at our Sunday service. We hope that you
      will feel welcome as you meet our church family.
    </p>
    <h2 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      We seek to be a church community where Jesus radically transforms people’s
      lives and equips them to love one another and serve the world for God’s
      glory.

    <h2 id="our-beliefs">Our Beliefs</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          We believe in one God, living and true, everlasting, of infinite
          power, wisdom and goodness, the maker and preserver of all things,
          existing in three persons, namely, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We believe in Jesus Christ, the true God and true man, His virgin
          birth, His crucifixion and death to reconcile us to His father, being
          a sacrifice, not only for original guilt but also for all actual sins
          of mankind; His bodily resurrection, His ascension into Heaven and His
          coming again to judge all peoples.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We believe in the Holy Spirit, who proceeding from the Father and the
          Son, is of one substance with the Father and the Son. He is sent to
          dwell, guide, teach, and empower the believer and convict the world of
          sin, righteousness and of judgement.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We believe in the Canonical books of the Old and New Testaments which
          are a complete revelation of God’s will, and contain all things
          necessary for salvation. The Canonical books of the Old Testament are:
          Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges,
          Ruth, I and II Samuel, I and II Kings, I and II Chronicles, Ezra,
          Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Songs of
          Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel,
          Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai,
          Zechariah and Malachi. The Canonical books of the New Testament are:
          Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, the Acts of the Apostles, Romans, I and II
          Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, I and II
          Thessalonians, I and II Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Hebrews, James, I
          and II Peter, I, II and III John, Jude, and the Revelation to John.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We believe that all people were originally created in the image of
          God, fell through disobedience, thereby incurring both physical and
          spiritual death. All people are born with a sinful nature, separated
          from the life of God, and can be saved only through the atoning work
          of the Lord Jesus Christ. The portion of the non-penitent and
          unbelieving is existence in everlasting punishment, and that of the
          believer in everlasting joy.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We believe that salvation has been provided through the vicarious
          atonement of Jesus Christ for all people. Those who repent and believe
          in Him are born again of the Holy Spirit, receive the gift of eternal
          life, and become the children of God. We are accounted righteous (i.e.
          justified) before God, only through the atoning work of our Lord Jesus
          Christ by faith, and not by our own works.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We believe that sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit by which
          the child of God is separated from sin unto God and is enabled to love
          God with all his heart and to walk in all His holy commandments
          blameless. Sanctification is initiated at the moment of justification
          and regeneration. Thereafter, there is a progressive sanctification as
          a believer walks with God. It is followed by a life-long growth in
          grace and the knowledge of Jesus Christ and a life of holiness.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We believe that there shall be a bodily resurrection of the just to
          life and of the unjust to judgment.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We believe in the personal return or our Lord Jesus Christ. At his
          return, He will fulfil all prophecies made concerning His final and
          complete triumph over evil.
